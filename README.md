# Lab 7 - Stacks and Queues

### Stacks
You are provided with a **stack.h** header file that implements a Stack of strings. The comments explain how each function is expected to work.

You are also given an empty **stack.cpp** file where you will need to define each of the functions.

### Queues
You are provided with a **queue.h** header file that implements a Queue of strings. The comments explain how each function is expected to work.

You are also given an empty **queue.cpp** file where you will need to define each of the functions.

### Run command
`make test`

The tests.cpp file has six test cases. Do not edit the file, but feel free to open and read it.
You will be assigned 100 points if all tests pass.
